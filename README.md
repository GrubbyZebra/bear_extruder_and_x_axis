## Introduction

This is a better extruder and X axis for Prusa i3 printer MK2.5S and MK3S. It is a following of the [Bear Upgrade project](https://github.com/gregsaun/prusa_i3_bear_upgrade) and is still compatible with original Prusa's 3D printers.

The main goal of this extruder is to improve print quality, reliability and make maintenance easier.

:warning: The Bear X axis is **NOT** compatible with stock Prusa extruder!


## Features

Here is a list of improved features over stock Prusa extruder.

1. Improve print quality:
   * Better hotend cooling to improve consistency of layers deposition and to reduce clog, heatcreap and stringing (also check these [recommended hotend fans](optional_parts/hotend_fan))
   * Reduce flexing of X axis
   * Stiffer extruder uni-body to reduce vibration coming from Bondtech gears
   * Stiffer X axis and several improvements to reduce vibrations
   * Extruder is closer to X rods to reduce the lever arm and vibration
   * Bondtech drive gears closer to motor to reduce shaft flexing
   * Includes hotend collet clip to eliminate the risk of PTFE moving during retractions
   * More efficient part cooling thanks to nozzle fan duct and bottom shape of extruder
   * Belt path moved closer to top rod for smoother movements
   * Filament path is aligned according to Bondtech specifications (check [this issue](https://github.com/prusa3d/Original-Prusa-i3/issues/51))
   * Optional: X end idler for E3D Gates idler

1. Easier to maintain:
   * No need to disconnect cables from RAMBo to disassemble the extruder or access the belt
   * Z bearings installation made easier thanks to clamps
   * Simple and precise belt tensioning system with 3mm of adjustment
   * Self-centering of extruder motor
   * Easy installation and removing of E3D v6 hotend
   * Easier extruder assembly
   * No zip ties needed for X carriage bearings
   * Fewer screws

1. Improve reliability:
    * Parts designed to last
    * Better heat management
    * Reduce chance to melt extruder body
    * Vertical print fan to reduce bearing wear and noise
    * Reduce possible twist on X axis
    * Reduce chance of bad bearing alignment
    * Fewer screws
    * Extruder body in one piece

1. Support alternative extruders:
    * [E3D Hemera](https://e3d-online.com/e3d-hemera-175-kit)
    * [Bondtech Prusa Upgrade extruder](https://www.bondtech.se/en/product/prusa-i3-mk2-5-mk3-extruder-upgrade/)
    * [Bear extruder for MMU2S by vertigo235](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3472911)
    * [Gear box for Bear extruder by vertigo235](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3714978)

1. Several official and community optional parts
1. Open source by providing STL and Autodesk Fusion 360 files and STEP files



## Compatibility

Due to a different belt path, this extruder and X axis are matched to each other __and cannot be used separately__. As a unit, they are compatible with both Original Prusa and Bear Upgrade frames.

  * This Bear extruder version supports the new IR filament sensor introduced with latest Original Prusa MK2.5S/MK3S extruder.
  * This Bear extruder version is compatible with original Prusa firmware for daily use. However, (XY)Z calibration and selftest require a dedicated firmware for these steps only.
  * MK2.5 (non-S) and MK3 (non-S) is compatible with this Bear extruder version with the exception of the filament sensor.

In an effort to lengthen the Z axis, the original Prusa MK2.5S/MK3S hotend was raised by about 7 mm. This placement increases the ambient temperature around heatbreak and heatblock which could leads to print quality and reliability issues. We then have decided to not lengthen the Z axis in order to provide best printing experience. Because of this difference with original Prusa extruder, we provide a customized firmware to pass Selftest and (XY)Z Calibration. At the exception of these steps, the original Prusa firmware is completely compatible with our extruder.

The firmware is available here: https://github.com/bear-lab-3d/Prusa-Firmware/releases/
